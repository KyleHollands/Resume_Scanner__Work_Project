# Resume_Analyzer

Developed a Python script to streamline the resume screening process by converting .docx and .pdf files into plain text, removing formatting, and searching for specified keywords. Resumes containing at least 25% (customizable) of the target keywords are automatically moved to a designated folder for further review.

- File Format Conversion: Utilized libraries such as python-docx and PyMuPDF to extract text from .docx and .pdf files, respectively.
- Text Processing: Implemented functions to remove formatting and standardize text for consistent keyword matching.
- Keyword Matching: Developed a function to count occurrences of target keywords and calculate the percentage match.
- Automation: Automated the movement of qualifying resumes to a specified directory, enhancing efficiency in the hiring process.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Python scripting, text processing, and automation to improve HR workflows.
